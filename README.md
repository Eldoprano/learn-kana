# Learn-Kana
⚠️ This website is still under construction!!!

A website where you will be shoved Kana characters up to your brain, until you get them all.

# Requirements
- The main page will give the user the choice of selecting the kanas to practice.
- A beginner mode that slowly includes more characters into the mix should also be available.
- User progress and settings should be saved locally (And maybe give an online save option in the future)
- The learning page will consist of:
 - A minimalistic page showing the current Kana, or group of Kanas.
 - Users keyboard input will be showed below. Or buttons with possible answers.
 - User score will be showned in a corner
 - The background color will react according to the speed and correctness of the users answer (timed combos?)
 - A help window will also be available, showing Kanas with their romanjis, together with similar Kanas
 - When user decides to stop practicing (Or if a timer was set and finished) the user will be showed statistics:
  - How many Kanas you got
  - Kanas you have difficulties with (based on incorrect answers and... time?)
  - Average response time (ignores large time pauses)
